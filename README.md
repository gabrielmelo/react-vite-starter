## How to Get Started 🛠️
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-URL>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4. **Set up Commitizen**:
    ```bash
    npx commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact
    ```

    This command initializes Commitizen with the [cz-conventional-changelog](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-conventional-changelog) adapter, which enforces a standardized commit message format.

## Usage Tips 💡
- **Making Commits**: Instead of using `git commit`, use `npm run commit` to ensure your commit messages follow the standardized format.
    ```bash
    npm run commit
    ```
- **Building for Production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
- **Linting and Formatting**:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    npm run format
    ```
